    A Data ENcryption Search Engine
  </p>
</div>

## Introduction

This is a project to build a Data ENcryption Search Engine. Big data are nowadays everywhere. We already have many mature databases that help store data and many search engines that provide efficient data searching. However, due to privacy concerns, data owners may be reluctant to share their data. Those concerns not only reduces the value of data but also prevents the owner from getting benefits from the data. The situation will not get better if there is no such tool that either request a private query or search for encrypted data. DENSE is an attempt to build such a tool.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Data catalog: A universal blockchain that stores all data information.
- [ ] Data store: A database that stores owner's data.
- [ ] Query engine: A parser that plan data queries according to privacy policies.
- [ ] Secure protocols: A set of secure protocols (e.g., MPC, FHE, ZKP) that securely handle verifiable data queries.

## Components

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Communication: A communication layer that enables secure communication between components.
- [ ] Storage: A storage layer that stores data and metadata.
- [ ] Query: A query layer that plans data queries.
- [ ] Secure: A secure layer that securely handles data queries.
- [ ] Catalog: A catalog layer that stores data information.
- [ ] Frontend: A frontend layer that provides a user interface.
- [ ] Backend: A backend layer that provides a RESTful API.
- [ ] Database: A database layer that stores data.
- [ ] Cache: A cache layer that caches data.
- [ ] Logging: A logging layer that logs data.
- [ ] Monitoring: A monitoring layer that monitors data.
- [ ] Testing: A testing layer that tests data.

### Data

- [ ] Data: A data layer that stores data.
- [ ] Encryption: A encryption layer that encrypts data.
- [ ] Decryption: A decryption layer that decrypts data.
- [ ] Privacy: A privacy layer that protects data.
- [ ] Privacy Policy: A privacy policy layer that defines privacy policies.
- [ ] Privacy Policy Checker: A privacy policy checker layer that checks privacy policies.
- [ ] Privacy Policy Generator: A privacy policy generator layer that generates privacy policies.
- [ ] Privacy Policy Validator: A privacy policy validator layer that validates privacy policies.
- [ ] Privacy Policy Updater: A privacy policy updater layer that updates privacy policies.
- [ ] Privacy Policy Deleter: A privacy policy deleter layer that deletes privacy policies.
- [ ] Privacy Policy Reader: A privacy policy reader layer that reads privacy policies.
- [ ] Privacy Policy Writer: A privacy policy writer layer that writes privacy policies.
- [ ] Privacy Policy Manager: A privacy policy manager layer that manages privacy policies.
