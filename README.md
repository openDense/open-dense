    A Data ENcryption Search Engine

## Introduction

This is a project to build a Data ENcryption Search Engine. Big data are nowadays everywhere. We already have many mature databases that help store data and many search engines that provide efficient data searching. However, due to privacy concerns, data owners may be reluctant to share their data. Those concerns not only reduces the value of data but also prevents the owner from getting benefits from the data. The situation will not get better if there is no such tool that either request a private query or search for encrypted data. DENSE is an attempt to build such a tool.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Data catalog: A universal blockchain that stores all data information.
- [ ] Data store: A database that stores owner's data.
- [ ] Query engine: A parser that plan data queries according to privacy policies.
- [ ] Secure protocols: A set of secure protocols (e.g., MPC, FHE, ZKP) that securely handle verifiable data queries.
